This device is able to control the speed and the current of a DC Motor. With the help of the current and torque constant of the motor, we are also able to control the torque of it. In addition, with the help of an encoder, we can calculate the speed and theta of the motor and reach a desired position or speed.
Currently, this device is being used to do research on stability and transparency of haptic robots.
