In this project, I designed and constructed a simple thermal camera by TPA81 infra-red thermal sensor. TPA81 is a thermopile array detecting infra-red in the 2um-22um range. It has an array of eight thermopiles arranged in a row so that it can measure the temperature of 8 adjacent points simultaneously. Through attaching this sensor to the top of a servo motor, we can create a thermal image and have a simple thermal camera.

Then, the output image, visualized by RVIZ with regards to ambient temperature:

In the above image, you can see a thermal image of me, opening my arms in front of the camera.
