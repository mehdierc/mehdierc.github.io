    I'm a senior undergraduate student at the Isfahan University of Technology, graduating December of 2016 with a B.Sc degree in computer software engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Also, I'm working as research assistant at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, working on design and fabrication of different robotic and mechatronic systems. Furthermore, I'm in close association with University of Isfahan, Department of Mechanical Engineering.
    <br>I have a well-rounded background in robotics, specifically in artificial intelligence, control theory, reinforcement learning,  and mechatronics. Moreover, I have broad experience in programming and algorithms, design and implementation of embedded systems, digital circuits, and real-time controllers.
    <br>I'm very interested in robotics. I've started learning and experiencing electronics and robotics since childhood, and now I'm planning to spend the rest of my life on researching and working in robotic related areas.
    So I'm looking forward to higher education as a bridge to my goals.
