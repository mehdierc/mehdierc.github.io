  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p align="justify">
    I recently finished my B.Sc. degree in <a href="http://www.iut.ac.ir/en/">Isfahan University of Technology (IUT)</a> majoring in Computer Engineering - Software.
    Currently, I am a research assistant at the <a href="http://mech.iut.ac.ir/en">Department of Mechanical Engineering</a>, Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory
    (<a href="http://armlab.iut.ac.ir/">ARMLab</a>), and my work is related to design and fabrication of different robotics and mechatronics systems. Furthermore, I'm in close association with
     <a href="http://www.ui.ac.ir/">University of Isfahan</a>, Department of Mechanical Engineering.
    <br>I have a well-rounded background in robotics, specifically in computer vision, artificial intelligence, mechatronics and control theory. Moreover, I have a
     <a href="/projects/">broad experience</a> in programming and algorithms, design and implementation of embedded systems, digital circuits, and real-time controllers.
    <br>I'm very interested in robotics. I've started learning and experiencing electronics and robotics <a href="/projects/#bowling">since childhood</a>, and I'm planning to spend
     the rest of my life on doing research and working in robotic related areas.
