    Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Polytechnic University of Milan</a>. Currently, I live in the city of
    Milano and enjoy great food, fashion, technology, and international atmosphere at the same time.
    <br>I have a well-rounded background in robotics and <a href="/projects/">good experience</a> in programming and algorithms, design and implementation of embedded systems, digital circuits, and real-time controllers.
    <br>I'm very interested in robotics. I've started learning and experiencing electronics and robotics <a href="/projects/#bowling">since childhood</a>, and I'm planning to spend
     the rest of my life on doing research and working in robotic related areas.
