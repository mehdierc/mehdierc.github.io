  <p align="justify">
    I'm a senior undergraduate student at the <a href="http://www.iut.ac.ir/en/">Isfahan University of Technology</a>, graduating December of 2016 with a B.Sc degree in computer engineering (Software) from the <a href="http://ece.iut.ac.ir/en">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. Also, I'm working as research assistant at the <a href="http://mech.iut.ac.ir/en">Department of Mechanical Engineering</a>, Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory (<a href="http://armlab.iut.ac.ir/">ARMLab</a>), working on design and fabrication of different robotic and mechatronic systems. Furthermore, I'm in close association with <a href="http://www.ui.ac.ir/">University of Isfahan</a>, Department of Mechanical Engineering.
    <br>I have a well-rounded background in robotics, specifically in mechatronics, artificial intelligence, control theory and reinforcement learning. Moreover, I have <a href="/projects/">broad experience</a> in programming and algorithms, design and implementation of embedded systems, digital circuits, and real-time controllers.
    <br>I'm very interested in robotics. I've started learning and experiencing electronics and robotics <a href="/projects/#bowling">since childhood</a>, and now I'm planning to spend the rest of my life on researching and working in robotic related areas.
    So I'm looking forward to higher education as a bridge to my goals.
